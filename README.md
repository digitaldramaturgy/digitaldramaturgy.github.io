## Built on CollectionBuilder

Digital Dramaturgy is built on [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), an open-source framework for creating digital collection websites with Jekyll. CollectionBuilder transforms collection metadata into engaging visualizations and browsable exhibits.

The platform generates static sites that can be hosted on any basic web server or deployed automatically via GitHub Pages. It uses modern web technologies including Bootstrap, DataTables, Leaflet, and Lunr.js.

For more information about extending your Digital Dramaturgy site with additional features, visit the [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/).
