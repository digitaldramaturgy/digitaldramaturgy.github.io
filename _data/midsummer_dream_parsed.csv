I,I,StageDirection,"Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants."
I,I,THESEUS,"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour"
I,I,THESEUS,Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
I,I,THESEUS,"Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow"
I,I,THESEUS,"This old moon wanes\! she lingers my desires,"
I,I,HIPPOLYTA,Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
I,I,HIPPOLYTA,Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
I,I,HIPPOLYTA,"And then the moon, like to a silver bow"
I,I,HIPPOLYTA,"New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night"
I,I,HIPPOLYTA,Of our solemnities.
I,I,THESEUS,"Go, Philostrate,"
I,I,THESEUS,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
I,I,THESEUS,Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.
I,I,StageDirection,Exit PHILOSTRATE
I,I,THESEUS,"Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,"
I,I,THESEUS,And won thy love doing thee injuries;
I,I,THESEUS,"But I will wed thee in another key,"
I,I,THESEUS,"With pomp, with triumph and with revelling."
I,I,StageDirection,"Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS"
I,I,EGEUS,"Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke\!"
I,I,THESEUS,"Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?"
I,I,EGEUS,"Full of vexation come I, with complaint"
I,I,EGEUS,"Against my child, my daughter Hermia."
I,I,EGEUS,"Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,"
I,I,EGEUS,This man hath my consent to marry her.
I,I,EGEUS,"Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,"
I,I,EGEUS,This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
I,I,EGEUS,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,"
I,I,EGEUS,And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
I,I,EGEUS,"Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,"
I,I,EGEUS,"With feigning voice verses of feigning love,"
I,I,EGEUS,And stolen the impression of her fantasy
I,I,EGEUS,"With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,"
I,I,EGEUS,"Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers"
I,I,EGEUS,Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
I,I,EGEUS,"With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,"
I,I,EGEUS,"Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,"
I,I,EGEUS,"To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,"
I,I,EGEUS,Be it so she will not here before your grace
I,I,EGEUS,"Consent to marry with Demetrius,"
I,I,EGEUS,"I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,"
I,I,EGEUS,"As she is mine, I may dispose of her:"
I,I,EGEUS,Which shall be either to this gentleman
I,I,EGEUS,"Or to her death, according to our law."
I,I,THESEUS,"What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:"
I,I,THESEUS,To you your father should be as a god;
I,I,THESEUS,"One that composed your beauties, yea, and one"
I,I,THESEUS,To whom you are but as a form in wax
I,I,THESEUS,By him imprinted and within his power
I,I,THESEUS,To leave the figure or disfigure it.
I,I,THESEUS,Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
I,I,HERMIA,So is Lysander.
I,I,THESEUS,In himself he is;
I,I,THESEUS,"But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,"
I,I,THESEUS,The other must be held the worthier.
I,I,HERMIA,I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
I,I,THESEUS,Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
I,I,HERMIA,I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I,I,HERMIA,"I know not by what power I am made bold,"
I,I,HERMIA,But I beseech your grace that I may know
I,I,HERMIA,"The worst that may befall me in this case,"
I,I,HERMIA,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
I,I,THESEUS,Either to die the death or to abjure
I,I,THESEUS,Forever the society of men.
I,I,THESEUS,"Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;"
I,I,THESEUS,"Know of your youth, examine well your blood,"
I,I,THESEUS,"Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,"
I,I,THESEUS,"You can endure the livery of a nun,"
I,I,THESEUS,"To live a barren sister all your life,"
I,I,THESEUS,"Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon."
I,I,THESEUS,"O, earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,"
I,I,THESEUS,"Than that which withering on the virgin thorn,"
I,I,THESEUS,"Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness."
I,I,HERMIA,"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,"
I,I,HERMIA,Ere I will my virgin patent up
I,I,HERMIA,"Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke"
I,I,HERMIA,My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
I,I,THESEUS,"Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--"
I,I,THESEUS,"The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,"
I,I,THESEUS,Upon that day either prepare to die
I,I,THESEUS,"For disobedience to your father's will,"
I,I,THESEUS,"Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;"
I,I,THESEUS,Or on Diana's altar to protest
I,I,THESEUS,For aye austerity and single life.
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,Thy crazed title to my certain right.
I,I,LYSANDER,"You have her father's love, Demetrius;"
I,I,LYSANDER,Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
I,I,EGEUS,"Scornful Lysander\! true, he hath my love,"
I,I,EGEUS,And what is mine my love shall render him.
I,I,EGEUS,"And she is mine, and all my right of her"
I,I,EGEUS,I do estate unto Demetrius.
I,I,LYSANDER,"I am, my lord, as well derived as he,"
I,I,LYSANDER,As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
I,I,LYSANDER,"My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;"
I,I,LYSANDER,"And, which is more than all these boasts can be,"
I,I,LYSANDER,I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
I,I,LYSANDER,Why should not I then prosecute my right?
I,I,LYSANDER,"Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,"
I,I,LYSANDER,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
I,I,THESEUS,"I must confess that I have heard so much,"
I,I,THESEUS,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
I,I,THESEUS,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,"
I,I,THESEUS,"My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;"
I,I,THESEUS,"And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,"
I,I,THESEUS,I have some private schooling for you both.
I,I,THESEUS,"For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself"
I,I,THESEUS,To fit your fancies to your father's will;
I,I,THESEUS,Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
I,I,THESEUS,Which by no means we may extenuate--
I,I,THESEUS,"To death, or to a vow of single life."
I,I,THESEUS,"Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?"
I,I,THESEUS,"Demetrius and Egeus, go along."
I,I,EGEUS,With duty and desire we follow you.
I,I,StageDirection,Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
I,I,LYSANDER,"How now, my love\! why is your cheek so pale?"
I,I,LYSANDER,How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
I,I,HERMIA,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well"
I,I,HERMIA,Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
I,I,LYSANDER,"Ay me\! for aught that I could ever read,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Could ever hear by tale or history,"
I,I,LYSANDER,The course of true love never did run smooth;
I,I,LYSANDER,"But, either it was different in blood,--"
I,I,HERMIA,O cross\! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
I,I,LYSANDER,"Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--"
I,I,HERMIA,O hell\! to choose love by another's eyes.
I,I,LYSANDER,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Making it momentary as a sound,"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;"
I,I,LYSANDER,So quick bright things come to confusion.
I,I,HERMIA,"If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,"
I,I,HERMIA,"Then let us teach our trial patience,"
I,I,HERMIA,"Because it is a customary cross,"
I,I,HERMIA,"As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,"
I,I,HERMIA,"Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers."
I,I,LYSANDER,"A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia."
I,I,LYSANDER,"I have a widow aunt, a dowager"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Of great revenue, and she hath no child:"
I,I,LYSANDER,From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
I,I,LYSANDER,"There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;"
I,I,LYSANDER,And to that place the sharp Athenian law
I,I,LYSANDER,"Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,"
I,I,LYSANDER,Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
I,I,LYSANDER,"And in the wood, a league without the town,"
I,I,LYSANDER,There will I stay for thee.
I,I,HERMIA,My good Lysander\!
I,I,HERMIA,"I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,"
I,I,HERMIA,"By the simplicity of Venus' doves,"
I,I,HERMIA,"By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,"
I,I,HERMIA,"By all the vows that ever men have broke,"
I,I,HERMIA,"In number more than ever women spoke,"
I,I,HERMIA,"In that same place thou hast appointed me,"
I,I,HERMIA,To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
I,I,LYSANDER,"Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena."
I,I,StageDirection,Enter HELENA
I,I,HERMIA,God speed fair Helena\! whither away?
I,I,HELENA,Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
I,I,HELENA,Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair\!
I,I,HELENA,Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
I,I,HELENA,"More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,"
I,I,HELENA,"When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear."
I,I,HELENA,"Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,"
I,I,HELENA,"Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;"
I,I,HELENA,"O, teach me how you look, and with what art"
I,I,HELENA,You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
I,I,HERMIA,"I frown upon him, yet he loves me still."
I,I,HELENA,O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill\!
I,I,HERMIA,"I give him curses, yet he gives me love."
I,I,HELENA,O that my prayers could such affection move\!
I,I,HERMIA,"His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine."
I,I,HELENA,"None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine\!"
I,I,HERMIA,Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
I,I,HERMIA,Lysander and myself will fly this place.
I,I,HERMIA,"Before the time I did Lysander see,"
I,I,HERMIA,Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
I,I,HERMIA,"O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,"
I,I,HERMIA,That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell\!
I,I,LYSANDER,"Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:"
I,I,LYSANDER,"To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold"
I,I,LYSANDER,"Her silver visage in the watery glass,"
I,I,LYSANDER,Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
I,I,HERMIA,"And in the wood, where often you and I"
I,I,HERMIA,"Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,"
I,I,HERMIA,"Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,"
I,I,HERMIA,There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
I,I,HERMIA,"And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,"
I,I,HERMIA,To seek new friends and stranger companies.
I,I,HERMIA,"Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;"
I,I,HERMIA,And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius\!
I,I,HERMIA,"Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight"
I,I,HERMIA,From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
I,I,LYSANDER,"I will, my Hermia."
I,I,StageDirection,Exit HERMIA
I,I,LYSANDER,"Helena, adieu:"
I,I,LYSANDER,"As you on him, Demetrius dote on you\!"
I,I,StageDirection,Exit
I,I,HELENA,How happy some o'er other some can be\!
I,I,HELENA,Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
I,I,HELENA,But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
I,I,HELENA,"And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,"
I,I,HELENA,"So I, admiring of his qualities:"
I,I,HELENA,"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;"
I,I,HELENA,And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
I,I,HELENA,Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
I,I,HELENA,Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
I,I,HELENA,"And therefore is Love said to be a child,"
I,I,HELENA,Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
I,I,HELENA,"For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,"
I,I,HELENA,He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
I,I,HELENA,"And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,"
I,I,HELENA,"So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt."
I,I,HELENA,I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
I,I,HELENA,Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
I,I,HELENA,Pursue her; and for this intelligence
I,I,HELENA,"If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:"
I,I,HELENA,"But herein mean I to enrich my pain,"
I,I,HELENA,To have his sight thither and back again.
I,I,StageDirection,Exit
I,II,QUINCE,Is all our company here?
I,II,BOTTOM,"You were best to call them generally, one by one, according to the scrip."
I,II,QUINCE,"Here is the scroll of every one's name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his wedding-day at night."
I,II,BOTTOM,"First, good Petra Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point."
I,II,QUINCE,"Marry, our play is, *The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe*."
I,II,BOTTOM,"A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Petra Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Actors, spread yourselves."
I,II,QUINCE,"Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver."
I,II,BOTTOM,"Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed."
I,II,QUINCE,"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus."
I,II,BOTTOM,"What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?"
I,II,QUINCE,"A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love."
I,II,BOTTOM,"That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some"
I,II,BOTTOM,measure. To the rest. Yet my chief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Herc’les rarely.
I,II,BOTTOM,The raging rocks
I,II,BOTTOM,And shivering shocks
I,II,BOTTOM,Shall break the locks
I,II,BOTTOM,Of prison gates\!
I,II,BOTTOM,This was lofty\!
I,II,BOTTOM,Now name the rest of the players.
I,II,BOTTOM,"This is Herc’les' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling."
I,II,QUINCE,"Francis Flute, the bellows-mender."
I,II,FLUTE,"Here, Petra Quince."
I,II,QUINCE,"Flute, you must take Thisbe on you."
I,II,FLUTE,What is Thisbe? a wandering knight?
I,II,QUINCE,It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
I,II,FLUTE,"Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming."
I,II,QUINCE,"That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will."
I,II,BOTTOM,"An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too, I'll speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne, Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear.'"
I,II,QUINCE,"No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisbe."
I,II,BOTTOM,"Well, proceed."
I,II,QUINCE,"Robin Starveling, the tailor."
I,II,STARVELING,"Here, Petra Quince."
I,II,QUINCE,"Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe's mother. Nell Snout, the tinker."
I,II,SNOUT,"Here, Petra Quince."
I,II,QUINCE,"You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisbe's father: Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I hope, here is a play fitted."
I,II,SNUG,"Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study."
I,II,QUINCE,"You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring."
I,II,BOTTOM,"Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'"
I,II,QUINCE,"An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all."
I,II,ALL,"That would hang us, every mother's child."
I,II,BOTTOM,"I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any nightingale."
I,II,QUINCE,You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man;
I,II,QUINCE,"a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus."
I,II,BOTTOM,"Well, I will undertake it."
I,II,QUINCE,"Friends, here are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not."
I,II,BOTTOM,We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
I,II,QUINCE,At the duke's oak we meet.
I,II,BOTTOM,Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.                  	*Exeunt*
II,I,StageDirection,"Enter, from opposite sides, MUSTARDSEED and PUCK"
II,I,PUCK,"How now, spirit\! whither wander you?"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Over hill, over dale,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Thorough bush, thorough brier,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Over park, over pale,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Thorough flood, thorough fire,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"I do wander everywhere,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),Swifter than the moon's sphere;
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"And I serve the fairy queen,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),To dew her orbs upon the green.
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Those be rubies, fairy favours,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),In those freckles live their savours:.
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),"Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED (MOTH),Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
II,I,PUCK,The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
II,I,PUCK,Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
II,I,PUCK,"For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,"
II,I,PUCK,Because that she as her attendant hath
II,I,PUCK,"A lovely boy, stolen from a distant king;"
II,I,PUCK,And jealous Oberon would have the child
II,I,PUCK,"Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;"
II,I,PUCK,"But she perforce withholds the lovéd boy,"
II,I,PUCK,Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
II,I,PUCK,"And now they never meet in grove or green,"
II,I,PUCK,"By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,"
II,I,PUCK,"But, they do square, that all their elves for fear"
II,I,PUCK,Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,"Either I mistake your shape and making quite,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,That frights the maidens of the villagery;
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,"Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,"Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,"You do their work, and they shall have good luck:"
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,Are not you he?
II,I,PUCK,Thou speak'st aright;
II,I,PUCK,I am that merry wanderer of the night.
II,I,PUCK,I jest to Oberon and make him smile
II,I,PUCK,"When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,"
II,I,PUCK,Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
II,I,PUCK,"The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,"
II,I,PUCK,Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
II,I,PUCK,"Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,"
II,I,PUCK,And then the whole choir hold their hips and swear
II,I,PUCK,A merrier hour was never wasted there.
II,I,PUCK,"But, room, fairy\! here comes Oberon."
II,I,MUSTARDSEED,And here my mistress. Would that he were gone\!
II,I,StageDirection,"Enter, from one side, OBERON; from the other, TITANIA, with her fairies."
II,I,OBERON,"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania."
II,I,TITANIA,"What, jealous Oberon\! Fairies, skip hence:"
II,I,TITANIA,I have forsworn his bed and company.
II,I,OBERON,"Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?"
II,I,TITANIA,Then I must be thy lady: but I know
II,I,TITANIA,When thou hast stolen away from fairy land.
II,I,TITANIA,"Why art thou here,"
II,I,TITANIA,"But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,"
II,I,TITANIA,"Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,"
II,I,TITANIA,"To Theseus must be wedded, and you come"
II,I,TITANIA,To give their bed joy and prosperity.
II,I,OBERON,"How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,"
II,I,OBERON,"Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,"
II,I,OBERON,Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
II,I,TITANIA,These are the forgeries of jealousy:
II,I,TITANIA,"And never, since the middle summer's spring,"
II,I,TITANIA,"Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,"
II,I,TITANIA,"By paved fountain or by rushy brook,"
II,I,TITANIA,"To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,"
II,I,TITANIA,But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
II,I,TITANIA,"Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,"
II,I,TITANIA,"As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea"
II,I,TITANIA,Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
II,I,TITANIA,Have every pelting river made so proud
II,I,TITANIA,That they have overborne their continents:
II,I,TITANIA,"The ploughman’s lost his sweat, and the green corn"
II,I,TITANIA,Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard.
II,I,TITANIA,No night is now with hymn or carol blest.
II,I,TITANIA,"Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,"
II,I,TITANIA,"Pale in her anger, washes all the air,"
II,I,TITANIA,That rheumatic diseases do abound:
II,I,TITANIA,And thorough this distemperature we see
II,I,TITANIA,The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
II,I,TITANIA,"Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,"
II,I,TITANIA,And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
II,I,TITANIA,"The spring, the summer,"
II,I,TITANIA,"The childing autumn, angry winter, change"
II,I,TITANIA,"Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,"
II,I,TITANIA,"By their increase, now knows not which is which:"
II,I,TITANIA,And this same progeny of evils comes
II,I,TITANIA,"From our debate, from our dissension;"
II,I,TITANIA,We are their parents and original.
II,I,OBERON,Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
II,I,OBERON,Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
II,I,OBERON,"I do but beg a little changeling boy,"
II,I,OBERON,To be my henchman.
II,I,TITANIA,Set your heart at rest:
II,I,TITANIA,The fairy land buys not the child of me.
II,I,TITANIA,His mother was a votaress of my order:
II,I,TITANIA,"And, in the spiced seaside air, by night,"
II,I,TITANIA,"Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,"
II,I,TITANIA,"And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,"
II,I,TITANIA,"Marking the embarked traders on the flood,"
II,I,TITANIA,When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
II,I,TITANIA,And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
II,I,TITANIA,"Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait"
II,I,TITANIA,"Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--"
II,I,TITANIA,"Would imitate, and sail upon the land,"
II,I,TITANIA,"To fetch me trifles, and return again,"
II,I,TITANIA,"As from a voyage, rich with merchandise."
II,I,TITANIA,"But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;"
II,I,TITANIA,"And for her sake do I rear up her boy,"
II,I,TITANIA,And for her sake I will not part with him.
II,I,OBERON,How long within this wood intend you stay?
II,I,TITANIA,Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
II,I,TITANIA,If you will patiently dance in our round
II,I,TITANIA,"And see our moonlight revels, go with us;"
II,I,TITANIA,"If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts."
II,I,OBERON,"Give me that boy, and I will go with thee."
II,I,TITANIA,"Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away\!"
II,I,TITANIA,"We shall chide downright, if I longer stay."
II,I,StageDirection,Exit TITANIA with her train
II,I,OBERON,"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove"
II,I,OBERON,Till I torment thee for this injury.
II,I,OBERON,"My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest"
II,I,OBERON,"Since once I sat upon a promontory,"
II,I,OBERON,And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
II,I,OBERON,Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
II,I,OBERON,That the rude sea grew civil at her song.
II,I,PUCK,I remember.
II,I,OBERON,"That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,"
II,I,OBERON,"Flying between the cold moon and the earth,"
II,I,OBERON,Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
II,I,OBERON,"And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,"
II,I,OBERON,As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
II,I,OBERON,Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
II,I,OBERON,"It fell upon a little western flower,"
II,I,OBERON,"Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,"
II,I,OBERON,And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
II,I,OBERON,The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
II,I,OBERON,Will make or man or woman madly dote
II,I,OBERON,Upon the next live creature that it sees.
II,I,OBERON,Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
II,I,OBERON,Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
II,I,PUCK,I'll put a girdle round about the earth
II,I,PUCK,In forty minutes.
II,I,StageDirection,Exit
II,I,OBERON,"Having once this juice,"
II,I,OBERON,"I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,"
II,I,OBERON,And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
II,I,OBERON,"The next thing then she waking looks upon,"
II,I,OBERON,"Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,"
II,I,OBERON,"On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,"
II,I,OBERON,She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
II,I,OBERON,"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,"
II,I,OBERON,"As I can take it with another herb,"
II,I,OBERON,I'll make her render up her page to me.
II,I,OBERON,But who comes here? I am invisible;
II,I,OBERON,And I will overhear their conference.
II,I,StageDirection,"Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"I love thee not, therefore pursue me not."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"The one I'll stay, the other stayeth me."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood.
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"O get thee gone, and follow me no more."
II,I,HELENA,"You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;"
II,I,HELENA,"But yet you draw not iron, for my heart"
II,I,HELENA,"Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,"
II,I,HELENA,And I shall have no power to follow you.
II,I,DEMETRIUS,Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?"
II,I,HELENA,And even for that do I love you the more.
II,I,HELENA,"I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,"
II,I,HELENA,"The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:"
II,I,HELENA,"Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,"
II,I,HELENA,"Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,"
II,I,HELENA,"Unworthy as I am, to follow you."
II,I,HELENA,"What worser place can I beg in your love,--"
II,I,HELENA,"And yet a place of high respect with me,--"
II,I,HELENA,Than to be uséd as you use your dog?
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"You do impeach your modesty too much,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,To leave the city and commit yourself
II,I,DEMETRIUS,Into the hands of one that loves you not;
II,I,DEMETRIUS,To trust the opportunity of night
II,I,DEMETRIUS,And the ill counsel of a desert place
II,I,DEMETRIUS,With the rich worth of your virginity.
II,I,HELENA,Your virtue is my privilege------
II,I,HELENA,"Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,"
II,I,HELENA,For you in my respect are all the world:
II,I,HELENA,"Then how can it be said I am alone,"
II,I,HELENA,When all the world is here to look on me?
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
II,I,HELENA,The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
II,I,HELENA,"Run when you will, the story shall be changed:"
II,I,HELENA,"Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;"
II,I,HELENA,The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
II,I,HELENA,"Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,"
II,I,HELENA,When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
II,I,DEMETRIUS,I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Or, if thou follow me, do not believe"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
II,I,HELENA,"Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,"
II,I,HELENA,"You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius\!"
II,I,HELENA,Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
II,I,HELENA,"We cannot fight for love, as men may do;"
II,I,HELENA,We should be wooed and were not made to woo.
II,I,StageDirection,Exit DEMETRIUS
II,I,HELENA,"I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,"
II,I,HELENA,To die upon the hand I love so well.
II,I,StageDirection,Exit
II,I,OBERON,"Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,"
II,I,OBERON,Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
II,I,StageDirection,Re-enter PUCK
II,I,OBERON,"Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer."
II,I,PUCK,"Ay, there it is."
II,I,OBERON,"I pray thee, give it me."
II,I,OBERON,"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,"
II,I,OBERON,"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,"
II,I,OBERON,"There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,"
II,I,OBERON,Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
II,I,OBERON,"And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,"
II,I,OBERON,And make her full of hateful fantasies.
II,I,OBERON,"Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:"
II,I,OBERON,A sweet Athenian lady is in love
II,I,OBERON,With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
II,I,OBERON,But do it when the next thing he espies
II,I,OBERON,May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
II,I,OBERON,By the Athenian garments he hath on.
II,I,OBERON,And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
II,I,PUCK,"Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.      	*Exeunt*"
II,II,StageDirection,"Enter TITANIA, with her train"
II,II,TITANIA,"Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;"
II,II,TITANIA,"Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;"
II,II,TITANIA,"Some war with reremice for their leathern wings,"
II,II,TITANIA,"To make my small elves coats, and some keep back"
II,II,TITANIA,The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
II,II,TITANIA,At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
II,II,TITANIA,Then to your offices and let me rest.
II,II,StageDirection,The **FAIRIES** sing & play instruments:
II,II,TITANIA,"You spotted snakes with double tongue,"
II,II,TITANIA,"Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;"
II,II,TITANIA,"Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,"
II,II,TITANIA,Come not near our fairy queen.
II,II,TITANIA,"Philomel, with melody"
II,II,TITANIA,Sing in our sweet lullaby;
II,II,TITANIA,"Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:"
II,II,TITANIA,"Never harm,"
II,II,TITANIA,"Nor spell nor charm,"
II,II,TITANIA,Come our lovely lady nigh;
II,II,TITANIA,"So, good night, with lullaby."
II,II,TITANIA,"Weaving spiders, come not here;"
II,II,TITANIA,"Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence\!"
II,II,TITANIA,"Beetles black, approach not near;"
II,II,TITANIA,"Worm nor snail, do no offence."
II,II,TITANIA,"Philomel, with melody."
II,II,TITANIA,Sing in our sweet lullaby;
II,II,TITANIA,"Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:"
II,II,TITANIA,"Never harm,"
II,II,TITANIA,"Nor spell nor charm,"
II,II,TITANIA,Come our lovely lady nigh;
II,II,TITANIA,"So, good night, with lullaby."
II,II,MUSTARDSEED,"Hence, away\! now all is well:"
II,II,MUSTARDSEED,One aloof stand sentinel.
II,II,StageDirection,Exeunt Fairies except Cobweb. TITANIA sleeps.
II,II,StageDirection,Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids.
II,II,OBERON,"What thou seest when thou dost wake,"
II,II,OBERON,"Do it for thy true-love take,"
II,II,OBERON,Love and languish for his sake:
II,II,OBERON,"Be it mouse, or cat, or bear,"
II,II,OBERON,"’Pard, or boar with bristled hair,"
II,II,OBERON,In thy eye that shall appear
II,II,OBERON,"When thou wak’st, it is thy dear:"
II,II,OBERON,Wake when some vile thing is near.
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
II,II,StageDirection,Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA.
II,II,LYSANDER,"Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;"
II,II,LYSANDER,"And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:"
II,II,LYSANDER,"We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,"
II,II,LYSANDER,And tarry for the comfort of the day.
II,II,HERMIA,"Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;"
II,II,HERMIA,For I upon this bank will rest my head.
II,II,LYSANDER,One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
II,II,LYSANDER,"One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth."
II,II,HERMIA,"Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,"
II,II,HERMIA,"Lie further off yet, do not lie so near."
II,II,LYSANDER,"O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence\!"
II,II,LYSANDER,Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
II,II,LYSANDER,"I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit"
II,II,LYSANDER,So that but one heart we can make of it;
II,II,LYSANDER,Two bosoms interchainéd with an oath;
II,II,LYSANDER,So then two bosoms and a single troth.
II,II,LYSANDER,Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
II,II,LYSANDER,"For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie."
II,II,HERMIA,Lysander riddles very prettily:
II,II,HERMIA,"Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,"
II,II,HERMIA,If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
II,II,HERMIA,"But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy"
II,II,HERMIA,"Lie further off; in human modesty,"
II,II,HERMIA,Such separation as may well be said
II,II,HERMIA,"Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,"
II,II,HERMIA,"So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:"
II,II,HERMIA,Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end\!
II,II,LYSANDER,"Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;"
II,II,LYSANDER,And then end life when I end loyalty\!
II,II,LYSANDER,Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest\!
II,II,HERMIA,With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd\!
II,II,StageDirection,They sleep
II,II,StageDirection,Enter PUCK
II,II,PUCK,Through the forest have I gone.
II,II,PUCK,"But Athenian found I none,"
II,II,PUCK,Night and silence--Who is here?
II,II,PUCK,Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
II,II,PUCK,"This is he, my master said,"
II,II,PUCK,Despised the Athenian maid;
II,II,PUCK,"And here the maiden, sleeping sound,"
II,II,PUCK,On the dank and dirty ground.
II,II,PUCK,Pretty soul\! she durst not lie
II,II,PUCK,"Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy."
II,II,PUCK,"Churl, upon thy eyes I throw"
II,II,PUCK,All the power this charm doth owe.
II,II,PUCK,So awake when I am gone;
II,II,PUCK,For I must now to Oberon.
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
II,II,StageDirection,Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA.
II,II,HELENA,"Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius."
II,II,DEMETRIUS,"I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus."
II,II,HELENA,"O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so."
II,II,DEMETRIUS,"Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go."
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
II,II,HELENA,"Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;"
II,II,HELENA,For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
II,II,HELENA,How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
II,II,HELENA,"If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers."
II,II,HELENA,"No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;"
II,II,HELENA,For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
II,II,HELENA,Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
II,II,HELENA,"Do, as a monster fly my presence thus."
II,II,HELENA,But who is here? Lysander\! on the ground\!
II,II,HELENA,"Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound."
II,II,HELENA,"Lysander if you live, good sir, awake."
II,II,LYSANDER,\[Awaking\] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
II,II,LYSANDER,"Transparent Helena\! Nature shows art,"
II,II,LYSANDER,That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
II,II,LYSANDER,"Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word"
II,II,LYSANDER,Is that vile name to perish on my sword\!
II,II,HELENA,"Do not say so, Lysander; say not so"
II,II,HELENA,"What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?"
II,II,HELENA,Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
II,II,LYSANDER,Content with Hermia\! No; I do repent
II,II,LYSANDER,The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
II,II,LYSANDER,Not Hermia but Helena I love:
II,II,LYSANDER,Who will not change a raven for a dove?
II,II,LYSANDER,Things growing are not ripe until their season
II,II,LYSANDER,"So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;"
II,II,LYSANDER,Reason becomes the marshal to my will
II,II,LYSANDER,"And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook"
II,II,LYSANDER,Love's stories written in love's richest book.
II,II,HELENA,Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
II,II,HELENA,When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
II,II,HELENA,"Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,"
II,II,HELENA,"That I did never, no, nor never can,"
II,II,HELENA,"Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,"
II,II,HELENA,But you must flout my insufficiency?
II,II,HELENA,"Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,"
II,II,HELENA,In such disdainful manner me to woo.
II,II,HELENA,"O, that a lady, of one man refused."
II,II,HELENA,Should of another therefore be abused\!
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
II,II,LYSANDER,"She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:"
II,II,LYSANDER,And never mayst thou come Lysander near\!
II,II,LYSANDER,For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
II,II,LYSANDER,"The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,"
II,II,LYSANDER,"So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,"
II,II,LYSANDER,"Of all be hated, but the most of me\!"
II,II,LYSANDER,"And, all my powers, address your love and might"
II,II,LYSANDER,To honour Helen and to be her knight\!
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
II,II,HERMIA,"\[Awaking\] Help me, Lysander, help me\! do thy best"
II,II,HERMIA,To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast\!
II,II,HERMIA,"Ay me, for pity\! what a dream was here\!"
II,II,HERMIA,"Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:"
II,II,HERMIA,"Methought a serpent eat my heart away,"
II,II,HERMIA,And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
II,II,HERMIA,"Lysander\! what, removed? Lysander\! lord\!"
II,II,HERMIA,"Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;"
II,II,HERMIA,"Speak, of all loves\! I swoon almost with fear."
II,II,HERMIA,No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh
II,II,HERMIA,Either death or you I'll find immediately.
II,II,StageDirection,Exit
III,I,StageDirection,"Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING."
III,I,BOTTOM,Are we all met?
III,I,QUINCE,"Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke."
III,I,BOTTOM,Petra Quince?
III,I,QUINCE,"What sayest thou, bully Bottom?"
III,I,BOTTOM,"There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?"
III,I,SNOUT,"By'r lakin, a parlous fear."
III,I,STARVELING,"I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done."
III,I,BOTTOM,"Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to say that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance, that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear."
III,I,QUINCE,"Well, we will have such a prologue."
III,I,SNOUT,Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
III,I,STARVELING,"I fear it, I promise you."
III,I,BOTTOM,"Friends, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in--God shield us\!--a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living."
III,I,SNOUT,Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
III,I,BOTTOM,"Nay, you must name her name, and half her face must be seen through the lion's neck: and she herself must speak through, saying thus: 'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish you,'--or ‘I would entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble. I come hither as a lion, but I am no such thing; I am a woman as other women are'; and let her tell them plainly she is Snug the joiner."
III,I,QUINCE,"Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things; that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight."
III,I,SNOUT,Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
III,I,BOTTOM,"A calendar, a calendar\! Look in the almanac.  Find out moonshine, find out moonshine."
III,I,QUINCE,"Yes, it doth shine that night."
III,I,BOTTOM,"Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon may shine in."
III,I,QUINCE,"Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall."
III,I,SNUG,"You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?"
III,I,BOTTOM,"Some one or other must present Wall: and let her have some plaster, or some loam, about her, to signify wall; and let her hold her fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper."
III,I,QUINCE,"If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother's child, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake: and so every one according to their cue."
III,I,StageDirection,Enter PUCK behind.
III,I,PUCK,"What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,"
III,I,PUCK,So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
III,I,PUCK,"What, a play toward\! I'll be an auditor;"
III,I,PUCK,"An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause."
III,I,QUINCE,"Speak, Pyramus. Thisbe, stand forth."
III,I,BOTTOM,"Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--"
III,I,QUINCE,"Odours, odours."
III,I,BOTTOM,\--odours savours sweet:
III,I,BOTTOM,"So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear."
III,I,BOTTOM,"But hark, a voice\! stay thou but here awhile,"
III,I,BOTTOM,And by and by I will to thee appear.                       	*Exit*
III,I,PUCK,A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.		*Exit*
III,I,FLUTE,Must I speak now?
III,I,QUINCE,"Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again."
III,I,FLUTE,"Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,"
III,I,FLUTE,"Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,"
III,I,FLUTE,"Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely view,"
III,I,FLUTE,"As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,"
III,I,FLUTE,"I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb."
III,I,QUINCE,"'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is, 'never tire.'"
III,I,FLUTE,"O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire."
III,I,StageDirection,"Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head."
III,I,BOTTOM,"If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine."
III,I,BOTTOM,"O monstrous\! O strange\! we are haunted. Pray, masters\! fly, friends\! Help\!"
III,I,StageDirection,"Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING"
III,I,PUCK,"I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,"
III,I,PUCK,"Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:"
III,I,PUCK,"Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,"
III,I,PUCK,"A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;"
III,I,PUCK,"And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,"
III,I,PUCK,"Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.            	*Exit*"
III,I,BOTTOM,Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard.
III,I,StageDirection,Re-enter SNOUT.
III,I,SNUG,"O Bottom, thou art changed\! what do I see on thee?"
III,I,BOTTOM,"What do you see? You see an asshead of your own, do you?"
III,I,StageDirection,Exit SNOUT; re-enter QUINCE.
III,I,QUINCE,"Bless thee, Bottom\! bless thee\! thou art translated."
III,I,StageDirection,Exit
III,I,BOTTOM,"I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place: I will walk up and down, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid."
III,I,StageDirection,Sings
III,I,BOTTOM,"The ousel bird so black of hue,"
III,I,BOTTOM,"With orange-tawny bill,"
III,I,BOTTOM,"The throstle with his note so true,"
III,I,BOTTOM,"The wren with little quill,--"
III,I,TITANIA,\[Awaking\] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
III,I,StageDirection,Sings
III,I,BOTTOM,"The finch, the sparrow and the lark,"
III,I,BOTTOM,"The plain-song cuckoo gray,"
III,I,BOTTOM,"Whose note full many a man doth mark,"
III,I,BOTTOM,And dares not answer nay;--
III,I,BOTTOM,"For, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?"
III,I,TITANIA,"I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:"
III,I,TITANIA,Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
III,I,TITANIA,So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
III,I,TITANIA,And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
III,I,TITANIA,"On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee."
III,I,BOTTOM,"Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion."
III,I,TITANIA,Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
III,I,BOTTOM,"Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood,"
III,I,BOTTOM,I have enough to serve mine own turn.
III,I,TITANIA,Out of this wood do not desire to go:
III,I,TITANIA,"Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no."
III,I,TITANIA,I am a spirit of no common rate;
III,I,TITANIA,The summer still doth tend upon my state;
III,I,TITANIA,"And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;"
III,I,TITANIA,"I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,"
III,I,TITANIA,"And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,"
III,I,TITANIA,And sing while thou on presséd flowers dost sleep;
III,I,TITANIA,And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
III,I,TITANIA,That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
III,I,TITANIA,Peaseblossom\! Cobweb\! and Mustardseed\!

III,I,PEASEBLOSSOM,Ready.
III,I,COBWEB,And I.
III,I,MUSTARDSEED,And I.
III,I,ALL,Where shall we go?
III,I,TITANIA,Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
III,I,TITANIA,Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
III,I,TITANIA,"Feed him with apricots and dewberries,"
III,I,TITANIA,"With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;"
III,I,TITANIA,"The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,"
III,I,TITANIA,And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
III,I,TITANIA,"And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,"
III,I,TITANIA,To have my love to bed and to arise;
III,I,TITANIA,And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
III,I,TITANIA,To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
III,I,TITANIA,"Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies."
III,I,PEASEBLOSSOM,"Hail, mortal\!"
III,I,MUSTARDSEED,Hail\!
III,I,BOTTOM,"I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your worship's name."
III,I,COBWEB,Cobweb.
III,I,BOTTOM,"I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name, honest dame?"
III,I,PEASEBLOSSOM,Peaseblossom.
III,I,BOTTOM,"I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Your name, I beseech you, ma’am?"
III,I,MUSTARDSEED,Mustardseed.
III,I,BOTTOM,"Good Mistress Mustardseed, I promise you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I desire your more acquaintance, good Mistress Mustardseed."
III,I,TITANIA,"Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower."
III,I,TITANIA,Tie up my love's tongue. Bring him silently.
III,I,StageDirection,Exeunt
III,II,StageDirection,Enter OBERON
III,II,OBERON,I wonder if Titania be awaked;
III,II,OBERON,"Then, what it was that next came in her eye,"
III,II,OBERON,Which she must dote on in extremity.
III,II,StageDirection,Enter PUCK
III,II,OBERON,Here comes my messenger.
III,II,OBERON,"How now, mad spirit\!"
III,II,OBERON,What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
III,II,PUCK,My mistress with a monster is in love.
III,II,PUCK,"Near to her close and consecrated bower,"
III,II,PUCK,"While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,"
III,II,PUCK,"A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,"
III,II,PUCK,Were met together to rehearse a play
III,II,PUCK,Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
III,II,PUCK,"The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,"
III,II,PUCK,"Who Pyramus presented, in their sport"
III,II,PUCK,Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
III,II,PUCK,"When I did him at this advantage take,"
III,II,PUCK,An ass's pate I fixéd on his head:
III,II,PUCK,"Anon his Thisbe must be answered,"
III,II,PUCK,"And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,"
III,II,PUCK,"And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;"
III,II,PUCK,He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
III,II,PUCK,"I led them on in this distracted fear,"
III,II,PUCK,And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
III,II,PUCK,"When in that moment, so it came to pass,"
III,II,PUCK,Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
III,II,OBERON,This falls out better than I could devise.
III,II,OBERON,But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
III,II,OBERON,"With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?"
III,II,PUCK,"I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--"
III,II,PUCK,And the Athenian woman by his side:
III,II,PUCK,"That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed."
III,II,StageDirection,Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
III,II,OBERON,Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
III,II,PUCK,"This is the woman, but not this the man."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
III,II,HERMIA,"If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,"
III,II,HERMIA,"Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,"
III,II,HERMIA,And kill me too.
III,II,HERMIA,The sun was not so true unto the day
III,II,HERMIA,As he to me: would he have stolen away
III,II,HERMIA,From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
III,II,HERMIA,This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
III,II,HERMIA,May through the centre creep.
III,II,HERMIA,It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
III,II,HERMIA,"So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"So should the murder'd look, and so should I,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
III,II,HERMIA,What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
III,II,HERMIA,"Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
III,II,HERMIA,"Out, dog\! out, cur\! thou drivest me past the bounds"
III,II,HERMIA,"Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?"
III,II,HERMIA,And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch\!
III,II,HERMIA,"Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell."
III,II,HERMIA,"I pray thee, tell me then that he is well."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"An if I could, what should I get therefore?"
III,II,HERMIA,A privilege never to see me more.
III,II,StageDirection,Exit
III,II,DEMETRIUS,There is no following her in this fierce vein:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Here therefore for a while I will remain.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
III,II,DEMETRIUS,For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Which now in some slight measure it will pay,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,If for his tender here I make some stay.
III,II,StageDirection,Lies down and sleeps
III,II,OBERON,What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
III,II,OBERON,And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
III,II,OBERON,"About the wood go swifter than the wind,"
III,II,OBERON,And Helena of Athens look thou find:
III,II,OBERON,"All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,"
III,II,OBERON,"With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:"
III,II,OBERON,By some illusion see thou bring her here:
III,II,OBERON,I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
III,II,PUCK,"I go, I go; look how I go,"
III,II,PUCK,Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
III,II,StageDirection,Exit
III,II,OBERON,"Flower of this purple dye,"
III,II,OBERON,"Hit with Cupid's archery,"
III,II,OBERON,Sink in apple of his eye.
III,II,OBERON,"When thou wakest, if she be by,"
III,II,OBERON,Let her shine as gloriously
III,II,OBERON,As the Venus of the sky.
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter PUCK
III,II,PUCK,"Captain of our fairy band,"
III,II,PUCK,Helena is here at hand;
III,II,PUCK,"And the youth, mistook by me,"
III,II,PUCK,Pleading for a lover's fee.
III,II,PUCK,Shall we their fond pageant see?
III,II,PUCK,"Lord, what fools these mortals be\!"
III,II,OBERON,Stand aside: the noise they make
III,II,OBERON,Will cause Demetrius to awake.
III,II,PUCK,Then will two at once woo one;
III,II,PUCK,That must needs be sport alone\!
III,II,StageDirection,Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
III,II,LYSANDER,"Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,"
III,II,LYSANDER,In their nativity all truth appears.
III,II,LYSANDER,"How can these things in me seem scorn to you,"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?"
III,II,HELENA,These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
III,II,HELENA,"Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:"
III,II,HELENA,"Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,"
III,II,HELENA,"Will even weigh, and both as light as tales."
III,II,LYSANDER,I had no judgment when to her I swore.
III,II,HELENA,"Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er."
III,II,LYSANDER,"Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"\[Awaking\] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine\!"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow\!"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss\!"
III,II,HELENA,O spite\! O hell\! I see you all are bent
III,II,HELENA,To set against me for your merriment:
III,II,HELENA,"If you we re civil and knew courtesy,"
III,II,HELENA,You would not do me thus much injury.
III,II,HELENA,"If you were men, as men you are in show,"
III,II,HELENA,You would not use a gentle lady so;
III,II,HELENA,"You both are rivals, and love Hermia;"
III,II,HELENA,"And now both rivals, to mock Helena:"
III,II,HELENA,"A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,"
III,II,HELENA,To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes.
III,II,LYSANDER,"You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;"
III,II,LYSANDER,For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
III,II,LYSANDER,"And here, with all good will, with all my heart,"
III,II,LYSANDER,In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
III,II,LYSANDER,"And yours of Helena to me bequeath,"
III,II,LYSANDER,Whom I do love and will do till my death.
III,II,HELENA,Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"And now to Helen is it home return'd,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,There to remain.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Helen, it is not so."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear."
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter HERMIA
III,II,HERMIA,"Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;"
III,II,HERMIA,"Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound"
III,II,HERMIA,But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
III,II,LYSANDER,"Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?"
III,II,HERMIA,What love could press Lysander from my side?
III,II,LYSANDER,"Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Fair Helena, who more engilds the night"
III,II,LYSANDER,Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,"
III,II,LYSANDER,The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
III,II,HERMIA,You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
III,II,HELENA,"Lo, she is one of this confederacy\!"
III,II,HELENA,Injurious Hermia\! most ungrateful maid\!
III,II,HELENA,"Have you conspired, have you with these contrived"
III,II,HELENA,To bait me with this foul derision?
III,II,HELENA,"Is all the counsel that we two have shared,"
III,II,HELENA,"The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,"
III,II,HELENA,When we have chid the hasty-footed time
III,II,HELENA,"For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?"
III,II,HELENA,"All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?"
III,II,HELENA,"We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,"
III,II,HELENA,"Have with our needles created both one flower,"
III,II,HELENA,"Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,"
III,II,HELENA,"As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,"
III,II,HELENA,"Had been incorporate. So we grow together,"
III,II,HELENA,"Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,"
III,II,HELENA,But yet an union in partition;
III,II,HELENA,Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
III,II,HELENA,"And will you rent our ancient love asunder,"
III,II,HELENA,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
III,II,HELENA,"It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:"
III,II,HELENA,"Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,"
III,II,HELENA,Though I alone do feel the injury.
III,II,HERMIA,I am amazed at your passionate words.
III,II,HERMIA,I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
III,II,HELENA,"Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,"
III,II,HELENA,To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
III,II,HELENA,"And made your other love, Demetrius,"
III,II,HELENA,"Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,"
III,II,HELENA,"To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,"
III,II,HELENA,"Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this"
III,II,HELENA,To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
III,II,HELENA,"Deny your love, so rich within his soul,"
III,II,HELENA,"And tender me, forsooth, affection,"
III,II,HELENA,"But by your setting on, by your consent?"
III,II,HERMIA,I understand not what you mean by this.
III,II,HELENA,"Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,"
III,II,HELENA,Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
III,II,HELENA,Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
III,II,HELENA,"If you have any pity, grace, or manners,"
III,II,HELENA,You would not make me such an argument.
III,II,HELENA,But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
III,II,HELENA,Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:"
III,II,LYSANDER,"My love, my life my soul, fair Helena\!"
III,II,HELENA,O excellent\!
III,II,HERMIA,"Sweet, do not scorn her so."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"If she cannot entreat, I can compel."
III,II,LYSANDER,Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,I say I love thee more than he can do.
III,II,LYSANDER,"If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Quick, come\!"
III,II,HERMIA,"Lysander, whereto tends all this?"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Away, you hobby horse\!"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"No, no; he'll seem to break loose"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"But yet come not: you are a tame man, go\!"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Hang off, thou cat, thou burr\! vile thing, let loose\!"
III,II,HERMIA,Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
III,II,HERMIA,"Sweet love,--"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Thy love\! Out hated potion, hence\!"
III,II,HERMIA,Do you not jest?
III,II,HELENA,"Yes, sooth; and so do you."
III,II,LYSANDER,"Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"I would I had your bond, for I perceive"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
III,II,LYSANDER,"What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so."
III,II,HERMIA,"What, can you do me greater harm than hate?"
III,II,HERMIA,"Hate me\! wherefore? O me\! what news, my love\!"
III,II,HERMIA,Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
III,II,HERMIA,I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
III,II,HERMIA,"Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid\!--"
III,II,HERMIA,"In earnest, shall I say?"
III,II,LYSANDER,And never did desire to see thee more.
III,II,LYSANDER,For I do hate thee and love Helena.
III,II,HERMIA,O me\! you juggler\! you canker-blossom\!
III,II,HERMIA,"You thief of love\! what, have you come by night"
III,II,HERMIA,And stolen my love's heart from him?
III,II,HELENA,I'faith\!
III,II,HELENA,"Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,"
III,II,HELENA,"Fie, fie\! you counterfeit, you puppet, you\!"
III,II,HERMIA,"Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game."
III,II,HERMIA,Now I perceive that she hath made compare
III,II,HERMIA,Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
III,II,HERMIA,"And with her personage, her tall personage,"
III,II,HERMIA,"Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him."
III,II,HERMIA,And are you grown so high in his esteem;
III,II,HERMIA,Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
III,II,HERMIA,"How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;"
III,II,HERMIA,How low am I? I am not yet so low
III,II,HERMIA,But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
III,II,HELENA,"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,"
III,II,HELENA,"Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,"
III,II,HELENA,"Because she is something lower than myself,"
III,II,HELENA,That I can match her.
III,II,HERMIA,"Lower\! hark, again."
III,II,HELENA,"Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me."
III,II,HELENA,"I evermore did love you, Hermia,"
III,II,HELENA,"Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;"
III,II,HELENA,"Save that, in love unto Demetrius,"
III,II,HELENA,I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
III,II,HELENA,He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
III,II,HELENA,But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
III,II,HELENA,"To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:"
III,II,HELENA,"And now, so you will let me quiet go,"
III,II,HELENA,To Athens will I bear my folly back
III,II,HELENA,And follow you no further: let me go:
III,II,HELENA,You see how simple and how fond I am.
III,II,HERMIA,"Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?"
III,II,HELENA,"A foolish heart, that I leave here behind."
III,II,HERMIA,"What, with Lysander?"
III,II,HELENA,With Demetrius.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part."
III,II,HELENA,"O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd\!"
III,II,HELENA,She was a vixen when she went to school;
III,II,HELENA,"And though she be but little, she is fierce."
III,II,HERMIA,'Little' again\! nothing but 'low' and 'little'\!
III,II,HERMIA,Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
III,II,HERMIA,Let me come to her.
III,II,LYSANDER,"Get you gone, you dwarf;"
III,II,LYSANDER,"You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;"
III,II,LYSANDER,"You bead, you acorn."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,You are too officious
III,II,DEMETRIUS,In her behalf that scorns your services.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Speak not of Helena; take not her part.
III,II,LYSANDER,Now she holds me not;
III,II,LYSANDER,"So follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,"
III,II,LYSANDER,"Of thine or mine, is most in Helena."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Follow\! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl."
III,II,StageDirection,Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
III,II,HERMIA,"You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:"
III,II,HERMIA,"Nay, go not back."
III,II,HELENA,"I will not trust you, I,"
III,II,HELENA,Nor longer stay in your curst company.
III,II,HELENA,"Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,"
III,II,HELENA,"My legs are longer though, to run away.                	*Exit*"
III,II,HERMIA,"I am amazed, and know not what to say.               	*Exit*"
III,II,OBERON,"This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,"
III,II,OBERON,Or else committ'st thy knaveries willfully.
III,II,PUCK,"Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook."
III,II,PUCK,Did not you tell me I should know the man
III,II,PUCK,By the Athenian garment be had on?
III,II,OBERON,Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
III,II,OBERON,"Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;"
III,II,OBERON,The starry welkin cover thou anon
III,II,OBERON,"With drooping fog as black as Acheron,"
III,II,OBERON,And lead these testy rivals so astray
III,II,OBERON,As one come not within another's way.
III,II,OBERON,Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
III,II,OBERON,With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
III,II,OBERON,Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
III,II,OBERON,"Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,"
III,II,OBERON,"When they next wake, all this derision"
III,II,OBERON,"Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,"
III,II,OBERON,"Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,"
III,II,OBERON,I'll to my queen and beg her changelling boy;
III,II,OBERON,And then I will her charmed eye release
III,II,OBERON,"From monster's view, and all things shall be peace."
III,II,PUCK,"My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,"
III,II,PUCK,"For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,"
III,II,PUCK,And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
III,II,PUCK,"At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,"
III,II,PUCK,"Troop home to churchyards, to their wormy beds."
III,II,OBERON,But we are spirits of another sort:
III,II,OBERON,"I with the morning's love have oft made sport,"
III,II,OBERON,"Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,"
III,II,OBERON,"Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,"
III,II,OBERON,Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
III,II,OBERON,"But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:"
III,II,OBERON,We may effect this business yet ere day.
III,II,StageDirection,Exit
III,II,PUCK,"Up and down, up and down,"
III,II,PUCK,I will lead them up and down:
III,II,PUCK,I am fear'd in field and town:
III,II,PUCK,"Goblin, lead them up and down."
III,II,PUCK,Here comes one.
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter LYSANDER
III,II,LYSANDER,"Where art thou, proud Demetrius?"
III,II,PUCK,"Here, villain; drawn and ready."
III,II,LYSANDER,I will be with thee straight.
III,II,PUCK,"Follow me, then, to plainer ground."
III,II,StageDirection,"Exit LYSANDER, following the voice."
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter DEMETRIUS.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Lysander\! speak again:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Speak\! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
III,II,PUCK,"Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,"
III,II,PUCK,"Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,"
III,II,PUCK,And wilt not come?
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Yea, art thou there?"
III,II,PUCK,Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here. 		*Exeunt*
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter LYSANDER
III,II,LYSANDER,The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
III,II,LYSANDER,"I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;"
III,II,LYSANDER,"That fallen am I in dark uneven way,"
III,II,LYSANDER,And here will rest me. (*Lies down.)*
III,II,LYSANDER,"Come, thou gentle day\!"
III,II,LYSANDER,"For if but once thou show me thy grey light,"
III,II,LYSANDER,I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.              	*Sleeps*
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS
III,II,PUCK,"Ho, ho, ho\! Coward, why comest thou not?"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"And darest not stand, nor look me in the face."
III,II,DEMETRIUS,Where art thou now?
III,II,PUCK,Come hither: I am here.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,If ever I thy face by daylight see:
III,II,DEMETRIUS,"Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me"
III,II,DEMETRIUS,To measure out my length on this cold bed.
III,II,DEMETRIUS,By day's approach look to be visited.            	*Lies down and sleeps*
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter HELENA
III,II,HELENA,"O weary night, O long and tedious night,"
III,II,HELENA,"Abate thy hour\! Shine comforts from the east,"
III,II,HELENA,"That I may back to Athens by daylight,"

III,II,HELENA,Steal me awhile from mine own company.	*Lies down and sleeps*
III,II,PUCK,Yet but three? Come one more;
III,II,PUCK,Two of both kinds make up four.
III,II,PUCK,"Here she comes, curst and sad:"
III,II,PUCK,"Cupid is a knavish lad,"
III,II,PUCK,Thus to make poor females mad.
III,II,StageDirection,Re-enter HERMIA
III,II,HERMIA,"Never so weary, never so in woe,"
III,II,HERMIA,"Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,"
III,II,HERMIA,Here will I rest me till the break of day.
III,II,HERMIA,"Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray\!"
III,II,StageDirection,Lies down and sleeps
III,II,PUCK,On the ground
III,II,PUCK,Sleep sound:
III,II,PUCK,I'll apply
III,II,PUCK,"To your eye,"
III,II,PUCK,"Gentle lover, remedy.  *Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes*"
III,II,PUCK,"When thou wakest,"
III,II,PUCK,Thou takest
III,II,PUCK,True delight
III,II,PUCK,In the sight
III,II,PUCK,Of thy former lady's eye:
III,II,PUCK,Jack shall have Jill;
III,II,PUCK,Nought shall go ill;
III,II,PUCK,"The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.		*Exit*"
IV,I,StageDirection,"Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen"
IV,I,TITANIA,"Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,"
IV,I,TITANIA,"While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,"
IV,I,TITANIA,"And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,"
IV,I,TITANIA,"And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy."
IV,I,BOTTOM,Where's Peaseblossom?
IV,I,PEASEBLOSSOM,Ready.
IV,I,BOTTOM,Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Cobweb?
IV,I,COBWEB,Ready.
IV,I,BOTTOM,"Cobweb, good Cobweb, get you your weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee, and bring me the honey-bag. And, good Cobweb, have a care the honey-bag break not. Where's Mustardseed?"
IV,I,MUSTARDSEED,What's your will?
IV,I,BOTTOM,"Nothing, good mistress, but to help Peaseblossom to scratch. I must to the barber's, for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch."
IV,I,TITANIA,"What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?"
IV,I,BOTTOM,I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs and the bones.
IV,I,TITANIA,"Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat."
IV,I,BOTTOM,"I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow."
IV,I,TITANIA,I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
IV,I,TITANIA,"The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts."
IV,I,BOTTOM,I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
IV,I,BOTTOM,"But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I have an exposition of sleep come upon me."
IV,I,TITANIA,"Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms."
IV,I,TITANIA,"Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.		*Exeunt fairies*"
IV,I,TITANIA,So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
IV,I,TITANIA,Gently entwist; the female ivy so
IV,I,TITANIA,Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
IV,I,TITANIA,"O, how I love thee\! how I dote on thee\!          	*They sleep*"
IV,I,StageDirection,Enter PUCK
IV,I,OBERON,"Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight?"
IV,I,OBERON,Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
IV,I,OBERON,"For, meeting her of late behind the wood,"
IV,I,OBERON,I then did ask of her her changeling child;
IV,I,OBERON,"Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent"
IV,I,OBERON,To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
IV,I,OBERON,"And now I have the boy, I will undo"
IV,I,OBERON,This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
IV,I,OBERON,"And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp"
IV,I,OBERON,From off the head of this Athenian swain;
IV,I,OBERON,"That, he awaking when the other do,"
IV,I,OBERON,May all to Athens back again repair
IV,I,OBERON,And think no more of this night's accidents
IV,I,OBERON,But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
IV,I,OBERON,But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
IV,I,OBERON,Be as thou wast wont to be;
IV,I,OBERON,See as thou wast wont to see:
IV,I,OBERON,Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
IV,I,OBERON,Hath such force and blessed power.
IV,I,OBERON,"Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen."
IV,I,TITANIA,My Oberon\! what visions have I seen\!
IV,I,TITANIA,Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
IV,I,OBERON,There lies your love.
IV,I,TITANIA,How came these things to pass?
IV,I,TITANIA,"O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now\!"
IV,I,OBERON,"Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head."
IV,I,OBERON,"Titania, music call; and strike more dead"
IV,I,OBERON,Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
IV,I,TITANIA,"Music, ho\! music, such as charmeth sleep\!"
IV,I,StageDirection,Music begins.
IV,I,PUCK,"Now, when thou wakest, with thine own fool's eyes peep."
IV,I,OBERON,"Sound, music\! Come, my queen, take hands with me,"
IV,I,OBERON,And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
IV,I,OBERON,"Now thou and I are new in amity,"
IV,I,OBERON,And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
IV,I,OBERON,"Dance in Duke Theseuss' house triumphantly,"
IV,I,OBERON,And bless it to all fair prosperity:
IV,I,OBERON,There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
IV,I,OBERON,"Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity."
IV,I,PUCK,"Fairy king, attend, and mark:"
IV,I,PUCK,I do hear the morning lark.
IV,I,OBERON,"We the globe can compass soon,"
IV,I,OBERON,Swifter than the wandering moon.
IV,I,TITANIA,"Come, my lord, and in our flight"
IV,I,TITANIA,Tell me how it came this night
IV,I,TITANIA,That I sleeping here was found
IV,I,TITANIA,With these mortals on the ground.       	*Exeunt*
IV,I,StageDirection,"Horns winded within;  Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, PHILOSTRATE, and train"
IV,I,THESEUS,"Go, one of you, find out the forester;"
IV,I,THESEUS,My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
IV,I,THESEUS,Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
IV,I,THESEUS,"Dispatch, I say, and find the forester."
IV,I,StageDirection,Exit an Attendant
IV,I,THESEUS,"We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,"
IV,I,THESEUS,And mark the musical confusion
IV,I,THESEUS,Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,"I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,"
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,"
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,"The skies, the fountains, every region near"
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
IV,I,HIPPOLYTA,"So musical a discord, such sweet thunder."
IV,I,THESEUS,"My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,"
IV,I,THESEUS,"Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,"
IV,I,THESEUS,Each under each. A cry more tuneable
IV,I,THESEUS,Was never holla'd to. Judge when you hear.
IV,I,THESEUS,"But, soft\! what nymphs are these?"
IV,I,EGEUS,"My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;"
IV,I,EGEUS,"And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;"
IV,I,EGEUS,"This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:"
IV,I,EGEUS,I wonder of their being here together.
IV,I,THESEUS,No doubt they rose up early to observe
IV,I,THESEUS,"The rite of May, and hearing our intent,"
IV,I,THESEUS,Came here in grace our solemnity.
IV,I,THESEUS,"But speak, Egeus; is not this the day"
IV,I,THESEUS,That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
IV,I,EGEUS,"It is, my lord."
IV,I,THESEUS,"Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns."
IV,I,StageDirection,"Horns and shouts within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and                                   HERMIA wake and start up."
IV,I,THESEUS,"Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:"
IV,I,THESEUS,Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
IV,I,LYSANDER,"Pardon, my lord."
IV,I,THESEUS,"I pray you all, stand up."
IV,I,THESEUS,I know you two are rival enemies:
IV,I,THESEUS,"How comes this gentle concord in the world,"
IV,I,THESEUS,"To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?"
IV,I,LYSANDER,"My lord, I shall reply amazedly,"
IV,I,LYSANDER,"Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,"
IV,I,LYSANDER,I cannot truly say how I came here;
IV,I,LYSANDER,"But now do I bethink me, so it is,--"
IV,I,LYSANDER,I came with Hermia hither: our intent
IV,I,LYSANDER,"Was to be gone from Athens, where we might"
IV,I,LYSANDER,Without the peril of the Athenian law---
IV,I,EGEUS,"Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:"
IV,I,EGEUS,"I beg the law, the law, upon his head."
IV,I,EGEUS,"They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,"
IV,I,EGEUS,"Thereby to have defeated you and me,"
IV,I,EGEUS,"You of your wife and me of my consent,"
IV,I,EGEUS,Of my consent that she should be your wife.
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"And I in fury hither follow'd them,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,Fair Helena in fancy following me.
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"Melted as the snow, seems to me now"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,As the remembrance of an idle gaud
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"The object and the pleasure of mine eye,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"Is only Helena. To her, my lord,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"But, as in health, come to my natural taste,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,And will for evermore be true to it.
IV,I,THESEUS,"Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:"
IV,I,THESEUS,Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
IV,I,THESEUS,"Egeus, I will overbear your will;"
IV,I,THESEUS,For in the temple by and by with us
IV,I,THESEUS,These couples shall eternally be knit:
IV,I,THESEUS,"And, for the morning now is something worn,"
IV,I,THESEUS,Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
IV,I,THESEUS,"Away with us to Athens. Come, Hippolyta."
IV,I,StageDirection,"Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train"
IV,I,HERMIA,"Methinks I see these things with parted eye,"
IV,I,HERMIA,When every thing seems double.
IV,I,HELENA,So methinks:
IV,I,HELENA,"And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,"
IV,I,HELENA,"Mine own, and not mine own."
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,Are you sure
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,That we are awake? Do not you think
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"The duke was here, and bid us follow him?"
IV,I,HERMIA,Yea; and my father.
IV,I,HELENA,And Hippolyta.
IV,I,LYSANDER,And he did bid us follow to the temple.
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,"Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him"
IV,I,DEMETRIUS,And by the way let us recount our dreams.
IV,I,StageDirection,Exeunt
IV,I,BOTTOM,"When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho\! Petra Quince\!  Flute, the bellows-mender\! Snout\! Starveling\!  God's my life, stolen hence, and left me asleep\!  I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, nor his tongue to conceive what my dream was. I will get Petra Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke.       *Exit*"
IV,II,StageDirection,"Enter QUINCE, SNOUT, SNUG, and STARVELING"
IV,II,QUINCE,Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
IV,II,STARVELING,He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
IV,II,SNOUT,"If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes not forward, doth it?"
IV,II,QUINCE,It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
IV,II,SNUG,"No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens."
IV,II,QUINCE,Yea and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
IV,II,StageDirection,Enter FLUTE
IV,II,FLUTE,"Friends, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married: if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men."
IV,II,SNUG,"O sweet bully Bottom\! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life.     An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged."
IV,II,SNOUT,"He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing."
IV,II,StageDirection,Enter BOTTOM
IV,II,BOTTOM,Where are these friends? where are these hearts?
IV,II,QUINCE,Bottom\! O most courageous day\! O most happy hour\!
IV,II,BOTTOM,"Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you every thing, right as it fell out."
IV,II,QUINCE,"Let us hear, sweet Bottom."
IV,II,BOTTOM,"Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not her that plays the lion pair her nails. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words: away\! go, away\!"
IV,II,StageDirection,Exeunt
V,I,StageDirection,"Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"'Tis strange my Theseus, that these lovers speak of."
V,I,THESEUS,More strange than true: I never may believe
V,I,THESEUS,"These antique fables, nor these fairy toys."
V,I,THESEUS,"The lunatic, the lover and the poet"
V,I,THESEUS,Are of imagination all compact:
V,I,THESEUS,"One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,"
V,I,THESEUS,"That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,"
V,I,THESEUS,Sees Helen's beauty in a pox-faced drudge:
V,I,THESEUS,And as imagination bodies forth
V,I,THESEUS,"The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen"
V,I,THESEUS,"Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing"
V,I,THESEUS,A local habitation and a name.
V,I,THESEUS,"Such tricks hath strong imagination,"
V,I,THESEUS,"O in the night, imagining some fear,"
V,I,THESEUS,How easy is a bush supposed a bear\!
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"But all the story of the night told over,"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"And all their minds transfigured so together,"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,More witnesseth than fancy's images
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,And grows to something of great constancy;
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"But, howsoever, strange and admirable."
V,I,StageDirection,"Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA"
V,I,THESEUS,"Joy, gentle friends\! joy and fresh days of love"
V,I,THESEUS,Accompany your hearts\!
V,I,LYSANDER,More than to us
V,I,LYSANDER,"Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed\!"
V,I,THESEUS,"Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,"
V,I,THESEUS,To wear away this long age of three hours
V,I,THESEUS,Between our after-supper and bed-time?
V,I,THESEUS,Where is our usual manager of mirth?
V,I,THESEUS,What revels are in hand? Call Philostrate.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Here, mighty Theseus."
V,I,THESEUS,"Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,Make choice of which your highness will see first.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"\[*Reads*\] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
V,I,THESEUS,"We'll none of that: that have I told my love,"
V,I,THESEUS,In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
V,I,THESEUS,That is an old device; and it was play'd
V,I,THESEUS,When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'"
V,I,THESEUS,"That is some satire, keen and critical,"
V,I,THESEUS,Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
V,I,THESEUS,Merry and tragical\! tedious and brief\!
V,I,THESEUS,How shall we find the concord of this discord?
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,Which is as brief as I have known a play;
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"There is not one word apt, one player fitted:"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"And tragical, my noble lord, it is;"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,The passion of loud laughter never shed.
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,What are they that do play it?
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Hard-handed folk that work in Athens here,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Which never labour'd in their minds till now,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"With this same play, against your nuptial."
V,I,THESEUS,And we will hear it.
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"No, my noble lord;"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"It is not for you: I have heard it over,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"And it is nothing, nothing in the world;"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Unless you can find sport in their intents,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,"
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,To do you service.
V,I,THESEUS,I will hear that play;
V,I,THESEUS,"For never anything can be amiss,"
V,I,THESEUS,When simpleness and duty tender it.
V,I,THESEUS,"Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies."
V,I,StageDirection,Exit PHILOSTRATE
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,And duty in his service perishing.
V,I,THESEUS,"Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,He says they can do nothing in this kind.
V,I,THESEUS,"The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing."
V,I,THESEUS,Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
V,I,THESEUS,"And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect"
V,I,THESEUS,"Takes it in might, not merit."
V,I,THESEUS,"Where I have come, great clerks have purposed"
V,I,THESEUS,To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
V,I,THESEUS,"Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Make periods in the midst of sentences,"
V,I,THESEUS,Throttle their practiced accent in their fears
V,I,THESEUS,"And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,"
V,I,THESEUS,Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
V,I,THESEUS,And in the modesty of fearful duty
V,I,THESEUS,I read as much as from the rattling tongue
V,I,THESEUS,Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
V,I,THESEUS,"Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity"
V,I,THESEUS,"In least speak most, to my capacity."
V,I,StageDirection,Re-enter PHILOSTRATE
V,I,PHILOSTRATE,"So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd."
V,I,THESEUS,Let him approach.
V,I,StageDirection,Flourish of trumpets
V,I,StageDirection,Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
V,I,THESEUS,"If we offend, it is with our good will."
V,I,THESEUS,"That you should think, we come not to offend,"
V,I,THESEUS,"But with good will. To show our simple skill,"
V,I,THESEUS,That is the true beginning of our end.
V,I,THESEUS,Consider then we come but in despite.
V,I,THESEUS,"We do not come as minding to contest you,"
V,I,THESEUS,Our true intent is. All for your delight
V,I,THESEUS,"We are not here. That you should here repent you,"
V,I,THESEUS,The actors are at hand and by their show
V,I,THESEUS,You shall know all that you are like to know.
V,I,LYSANDER,She hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop.
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Indeed she hath played on her prologue like a child on a recorder; a sound, but not in government."
V,I,THESEUS,Who is next?
V,I,StageDirection,"Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion"
V,I,THESEUS,"Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;"
V,I,THESEUS,"But wonder on, till truth make all things plain."
V,I,THESEUS,"This man is Pyramus, if you would know;"
V,I,THESEUS,This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.
V,I,THESEUS,"This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present"
V,I,THESEUS,"Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;"
V,I,THESEUS,"And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content"
V,I,THESEUS,To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
V,I,THESEUS,"This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,"
V,I,THESEUS,By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
V,I,THESEUS,"To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo."
V,I,THESEUS,"This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,"
V,I,THESEUS,"The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Did scare away, or rather did affright;"
V,I,THESEUS,"And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,"
V,I,THESEUS,Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
V,I,THESEUS,"Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,"
V,I,THESEUS,And finds his trusty Thisbe's mantle slain:
V,I,THESEUS,"Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,"
V,I,THESEUS,He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
V,I,THESEUS,"And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,"
V,I,THESEUS,"His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain"
V,I,THESEUS,"At large discourse, while here they do remain."
V,I,StageDirection,"Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine"
V,I,THESEUS,I wonder if the lion be to speak.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do."
V,I,DEMETRIUS,In this same interlude it doth befall
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"And such a wall, as I would have you think,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"That had in it a crannied hole or chink,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,Did whisper often very secretly.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"And this the cranny is, right and sinister,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
V,I,THESEUS,Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord."
V,I,StageDirection,Enter Pyramus
V,I,THESEUS,Pyramus draws near the wall: silence\!
V,I,THESEUS,O grim-look'd night\! O night with hue so black\!
V,I,THESEUS,"O night, which ever art when day is not\!"
V,I,THESEUS,"O night, O night\! alack, alack, alack,"
V,I,THESEUS,I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot\!
V,I,THESEUS,"And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,"
V,I,THESEUS,That stand'st between her father's ground and mine\!
V,I,THESEUS,"Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,"
V,I,THESEUS,"Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne\!"
V,I,StageDirection,Wall holds up his fingers
V,I,THESEUS,"Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this\!"
V,I,THESEUS,But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.
V,I,THESEUS,"O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss\!"
V,I,THESEUS,Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me\!
V,I,THESEUS,"The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again."
V,I,THESEUS,"No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' is Thisbe's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes."
V,I,StageDirection,Enter Thisbe
V,I,THESEUS,"O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,"
V,I,THESEUS,For parting my fair Pyramus and me\!
V,I,THESEUS,"My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,"
V,I,THESEUS,Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
V,I,THESEUS,"I see a voice: now will I to the chink,"
V,I,THESEUS,To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face. Thisbe\!
V,I,THESEUS,"My love thou art, my love I think."
V,I,THESEUS,"Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;"
V,I,THESEUS,"And, like Limander, am I trusty still."
V,I,THESEUS,"And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill."
V,I,THESEUS,O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall\!
V,I,THESEUS,"I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all."
V,I,THESEUS,Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
V,I,THESEUS,"'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay."
V,I,StageDirection,Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe
V,I,THESEUS,"Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;"
V,I,THESEUS,"And, being done, thus Wall away doth go."
V,I,StageDirection,Exit
V,I,THESEUS,Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
V,I,THESEUS,"The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"It must be your imagination then, and not theirs."
V,I,THESEUS,"If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion."
V,I,StageDirection,Enter Lion and Moonshine
V,I,THESEUS,"You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear"
V,I,THESEUS,"The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,"
V,I,THESEUS,"May now perchance both quake and tremble here,"
V,I,THESEUS,When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
V,I,THESEUS,"Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am"
V,I,THESEUS,"A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;"
V,I,THESEUS,"For, if I should as lion come in strife"
V,I,THESEUS,"Into this place, 'twere pity on my life."
V,I,THESEUS,"A very gentle beast, of a good conscience."
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw."
V,I,THESEUS,Let us listen to the moon.
V,I,THESEUS,This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
V,I,THESEUS,This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
V,I,THESEUS,Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
V,I,THESEUS,The man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the man i' the moon?
V,I,DEMETRIUS,He dares not come there for the candle.
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,I am aweary of this moon: would he would change\!
V,I,THESEUS,"It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time."
V,I,LYSANDER,"Proceed, Moon."
V,I,LYSANDER,"All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog."
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But, silence\! here comes Thisbe."
V,I,StageDirection,Enter Thisbe
V,I,DEMETRIUS,This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
V,I,DEMETRIUS,O\!  (*Roars\!\!\!)*
V,I,StageDirection,Thisbe runs off
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Well roared, Lion."
V,I,THESEUS,"Well run, Thisbe."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace."
V,I,StageDirection,"The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exits."
V,I,THESEUS,"Well moused, Lion."
V,I,LYSANDER,And so the lion vanished.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,And then came Pyramus.
V,I,StageDirection,Enter Pyramus
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"But stay, O spite\!"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"But mark, poor knight,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,What dreadful dole is here\!
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Eyes, do you see?"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,How can it be?
V,I,DEMETRIUS,O dainty duck\! O dear\!
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Thy mantle good,"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"What, stain'd with blood\!"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Approach, ye Furies fell\!"
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Quail, crush, conclude, and quell\!"
V,I,THESEUS,"This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame--"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Come, tears, confound;"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Out, sword, and wound"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,The pap of Pyramus;
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Ay, that left pap,"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,Where heart doth hop:     		*Stabs himself*
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Thus die I, thus, thus, thus."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Now am I dead,"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,Now am I fled;
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,My soul is in the sky:
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Tongue, lose thy light;"
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,Moon take thy flight.                  	*Exit Moonshine*
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,"Now die, die, die, die, die.           	*Dies*"
V,I,THESEUS,"With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and prove an ass."
V,I,HIPPOLYTA,How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
V,I,THESEUS,She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her passion ends the play.
V,I,StageDirection,Re-enter Thisbe
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us."
V,I,LYSANDER,She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
V,I,LYSANDER,"Asleep, my love?"
V,I,LYSANDER,"What, dead, my dove?"
V,I,LYSANDER,"O Pyramus, arise\!"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Speak, speak. Quite dumb?"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Dead, dead? A tomb"
V,I,LYSANDER,Must cover thy sweet eyes.
V,I,LYSANDER,"These lily lips,"
V,I,LYSANDER,"This cherry nose,"
V,I,LYSANDER,"These yellow cowslip cheeks,"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Are gone, are gone:"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Lovers, make moan:"
V,I,LYSANDER,His eyes were green as leeks.
V,I,LYSANDER,"O Sisters Three,"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Come, come to me,"
V,I,LYSANDER,With hands as pale as milk;
V,I,LYSANDER,"Lay them in gore,"
V,I,LYSANDER,Since you have shore
V,I,LYSANDER,With shears his thread of silk.
V,I,LYSANDER,"Tongue, not a word:"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Come, trusty sword;"
V,I,LYSANDER,"Come, blade, my breast imbrue:   	*Stabs \[her\]self*"
V,I,LYSANDER,"And, farewell, friends;"
V,I,LYSANDER,Thus Thisbe ends:
V,I,LYSANDER,"Adieu, adieu, adieu.                      	*Dies*"
V,I,THESEUS,Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
V,I,DEMETRIUS,"Ay, and Wall too."
V,I,BOTTOM,"\[*Starting up*\] No assure you; the wall is down. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance of our company?"
V,I,THESEUS,"No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed. T’was very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your"
V,I,THESEUS,epilogue alone.
V,I,StageDirection,"A dance, and the players exit."
V,I,THESEUS,The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
V,I,THESEUS,"Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time."
V,I,THESEUS,I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
V,I,THESEUS,As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
V,I,THESEUS,"Sweet friends, to bed."
V,I,StageDirection,Exeunt
V,I,StageDirection,Enter PUCK
V,I,PUCK,"Now the hungry lion roars,"
V,I,PUCK,And the wolf behowls the moon;
V,I,PUCK,"Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,"
V,I,PUCK,All with weary task fordone.
V,I,PUCK,Now it is the time of night
V,I,PUCK,"That the graves all gaping wide,"
V,I,PUCK,"Every one lets forth his sprite,"
V,I,PUCK,In the church-way paths to glide:
V,I,PUCK,"And we fairies, that do run"
V,I,PUCK,"By the triple Hecate's team,"
V,I,PUCK,"From the presence of the sun,"
V,I,PUCK,"Following darkness like a dream,"
V,I,PUCK,Now are frolic: not a mouse
V,I,PUCK,Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
V,I,PUCK,"I am sent with broom before,"
V,I,PUCK,To sweep the dust behind the door.
V,I,StageDirection,Enter OBERON and TITANIA with all their train.
V,I,OBERON,"Through the house give glimmering light,"
V,I,OBERON,By the dead and drowsy fire:
V,I,OBERON,Every elf and fairy sprite
V,I,OBERON,Hop as light as bird from brier.
V,I,TITANIA,"First, rehearse your song by rote,"
V,I,TITANIA,To each word a warbling note.
V,I,TITANIA,"Hand in hand, with fairy grace,"
V,I,TITANIA,"Will we sing, and bless this place."
V,I,StageDirection,Song and dance
V,I,OBERON,"Now, until the break of day,"
V,I,OBERON,Through this house each fairy stray.
V,I,OBERON,"And each several chamber bless,"
V,I,OBERON,"Through this palace, with sweet peace;"
V,I,OBERON,So shall all the couples three
V,I,OBERON,Ever true in loving be.
V,I,OBERON,"With this field-dew consecrate,"
V,I,OBERON,Every fairy take his gait;
V,I,OBERON,Trip away; make no stay;
V,I,OBERON,Meet me all by break of day.
V,I,StageDirection,"Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train."
V,I,PUCK,"If we shadows have offended,"
V,I,PUCK,"Think but this, and all is mended,"
V,I,PUCK,That you have but slumber'd here
V,I,PUCK,While these visions did appear.
V,I,PUCK,"And this weak and idle theme,"
V,I,PUCK,"No more yielding but a dream,"
V,I,PUCK,"Gentles, do not reprehend:"
V,I,PUCK,"if you pardon, we will mend:"
V,I,PUCK,"And, as I am an honest Puck,"
V,I,PUCK,If we have unearned luck
V,I,PUCK,"Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,"
V,I,PUCK,We will make amends ere long;
V,I,PUCK,Else the Puck a liar call;
V,I,PUCK,"So, good night unto you all."
V,I,PUCK,"Give me your hands, if we be friends,"
V,I,PUCK,And Robin shall restore amends.
