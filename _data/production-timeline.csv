Why it is important for this specific production context
Accompanying media (if any, it could be image, video, or audio)
In terms of how the page looks, I think we could go with two approaches: a text based approach that uses md for formatting; or a table-based organization model. Using a table would be most efficient for collaborators on the production, whereas a narrative text-based page (just like the interpretive essay above) may be more effective for audiences reading the site.
