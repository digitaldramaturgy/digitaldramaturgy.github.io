## About Digital Dramaturgy

The [Digital Dramaturgy](https://github.com/digitaldramaturgy/) enables the publication of annotated and edited playscripts that can be used as collaborative educational activities in classrooms or as dramaturgical aids and preservation measures for dramatic presentations. The tool takes an annotated Playscript in CSV/Spreadsheet form and builds a website from the data recorded. 

The project is directed by University of Idaho Theatre Professor Sarah Fogarty-Morrison and [Center for Digital Inquiry & Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) Co-Director Devein Becker. Fogarty-Morrison originally developed the idea as part of a CDIL Fellowship via the University of Idaho Library. She then  worked with Becker to design the tool and use it in her classroom. 

Digital Dramaturgy was awarded an NEH grant to support its development in 2025, but then that grant, along with so many others, was terminated by DOGE.
