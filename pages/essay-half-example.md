## The Monument of Print

The publication of Shakespeare's First Folio in 1623, seven years after the playwright's death, represents one of the most significant moments in English literary history. Without this collection, compiled by his fellow actors John Heminges and Henry Condell, we would have lost nearly half of Shakespeare's dramatic works forever.

## What the First Folio Preserved

The 1623 First Folio contains 36 plays, 18 of which had never been published before:

### Previously Unpublished Plays
- *Measure for Measure*
- *The Tempest*
- *Twelfth Night*
- *As You Like It*
- *All's Well That Ends Well*
- *Antony and Cleopatra*
- *Coriolanus*
- *Cymbeline*
- *Julius Caesar*
- *King John*
- *Macbeth*
- *The Comedy of Errors*
- *The Taming of the Shrew*
- *The Winter's Tale*
- *Timon of Athens*
- *1 Henry VI*
- *2 Henry VI*
- *3 Henry VI*

## Editorial Challenges

The creation of the First Folio presented numerous challenges for its compilers:

### Source Materials
- **Prompt books** from the theatre company
- **Fair copies** prepared by scribes
- **Foul papers** (author's drafts)
- **Memorial reconstructions** by actors

### Textual Variants
The editors had to make difficult choices when multiple versions of plays existed. For *Measure for Measure*, they had access to a relatively clean manuscript, resulting in one of the more reliable texts in the Folio.

## The Economics of Publishing

The First Folio was an expensive undertaking:

- **Price**: 15-20 shillings (equivalent to several hundred dollars today)
- **Print run**: Approximately 750 copies
- **Survival rate**: About 230 copies survive today
- **Financing**: Syndicated among four publishers to spread risk

## Modern Scholarly Impact

The First Folio continues to influence Shakespeare scholarship:

### Digital Humanities
Modern scholars use digital tools to analyze:
- **Compositor patterns** to understand printing practices
- **Textual variants** across surviving copies
- **Paper analysis** to determine printing chronology

### Performance Practice
Theatre companies often return to First Folio texts to discover:
- **Original staging intentions**
- **Character interpretations** suggested by spelling and punctuation
- **Collaborative authorship** evidence
