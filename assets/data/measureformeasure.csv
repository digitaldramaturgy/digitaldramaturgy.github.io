,,1,10,CLAUDIO,The [prenzie][precise] Angelo?,"The word **prenzie** has garnered much debate in scholastic circles and is considered still to be unresolved. According to an article in *Shakespeare Quarterly* dedicated solely to the discussion of this word, authors Anthony Edwards and Anthony Jenkins argue for retaining ""prenzie"" over the sometimes substitute, ""precise."" Citing other similar usages of the word outside Shakespeare and antedating *Measure for Measure*, Jenkins and Edwards argue that there is ""support for the argument that this is a genuine, contextually valid form"" (333). Their suggestion is that ""prenzie"" is likely an Elizabethan spelling for the Italian *prenze*, or ""prince.""",prenzie,,
,,1,10,ISABEL,"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,","Isabel contends with Claudio, that if Angelo is ""princely"" then it must be a clever disguise, that he wears ""cunning **livery**"" or special clothing reflecting his moral duties and yet is damnable inside.
