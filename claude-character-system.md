## Task: Character System

**Command:** `claude-code create-character-system`

**Description:** Build character pages and network visualization extending CollectionBuilder's visualization and card systems.

Use existing papa-parse structures and local session storage as defined in _includes/annotate/js/session-constants-js.html -- specifically the dd_characters_store array 
 
The visualization should be based solely on whether a character appears in the same scene or act with another character. 

**Files to Create:**

```
